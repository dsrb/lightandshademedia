Jono graduated from film school over 9 years ago, and since then has been so busy he’s barely slept since. He was one of the lucky few who stepped right into a fulltime career and has worked on everything from directing large live multi-camera productions, shooting and editing documentaries and promos,to creating motion graphics and VFX for a wide range of content for TV and online.

Before joining the team at Light + Shade he successfully ran his own production company for 4 years, and in that time developed a reputation amongst his clients as being one of the hardest working people around, who truly loves what he does.

His breadth of experience means whether he’s creating motion graphics or VFX, he’s passionate about and understands the role they play in telling a larger story that connects with and moves an audience.
