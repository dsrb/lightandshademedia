Sean has been in the industry since he was a teenager, starting his career as a childhood actor; moving into Network TV as a presenter on Totally wild in his early 20’s. Sean realised his passion lied behind the camera, crafting content into engaging stories as a producer.

Working across various programming at Network Ten for 7 years, Sean also produced TVC’s for the 10 Sales department before transferring over to Channel Seven’s Queensland flagship programming. His insatiable appetite for meaningful content and creating unique stories meant it was time to break out of Network TV and join the team at Light + Shade.

As a producer, Sean brings fastidious management and planning skills to every project, and is willing to engage in projects in any capacity that is required.He takes great pleasure in executing a well thought out plan, relishes the opportunity to help clients tell their stories and exceed their expectations.
