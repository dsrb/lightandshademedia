Emma developed an interest for advertising at a young age sporadically running for a variety of production companies. Her passion developed further when she started a small business, ‘The Production Runners’.

During her time as a production runner she worked across a large number of TV commercials and Stills with highly respected production companies in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. This venture exposed her to a variety of different production styles and allowed her to make connections to further continue her career in advertising.

Emma is now eager to expand her knowledge and experience in her role as a Production Coordinator for Light and Shade.

During her time managing a small business, Emma also managed full time university commitments, completing a Bachelor of Science, majoring in Psychology. The skills Emma gained during her tertiary training have been invaluable in her production career.
