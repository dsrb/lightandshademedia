With a varied post production career spanning 15 years, Pete has become one of Queensland’s most in-demand Editors. He’s cut prime-time programs and commercials for each of Australia’s free-to-air television networks, as well as a who’s who of corporate communicators around Brisbane.

Comfortable with pretty much every facet of the post production process, Pete believes that the heart of every project is the story. His ultimate talent lies in the creation of pieces that viewers connect with on an emotional level, always leaving a lasting impression.

Whether offlining a story, engineering and mixing audio, or colour grading a project to a perfect finish, Pete is always at his happiest when he’s manipulating media to create memorable content.
