Starting young in the media industry, Josh has had a diverse and interesting career to date. As an award winning Director and Cinematographer, Joshâ€™s unique skillset has seen him work across the globe on a range of projects.

His career started in documentaries, which included stints in Afghanistan, Africa, Antarctica, Europe, Asia, NZ and the USA.

From rescuing Bears in Romania and coming under rocket fire in Afghanistan, to digging his own bed in the Antarctic snow and dancing with Massaii Warriors in Kenya, all of these experiences have provided Josh with a very unique and creative approach to his filmmaking.

In the last few years Josh has translated his love of story telling and cinematography into the advertising world, where he has created commercials and content for some of the most recognisable brands and agencies around the globe.

In the last two years Josh has received several Australian Cinematography Awards as well as being nominated for a Logie. He brings a wealth of experience, passion and energy to every shoot he is involved in while approaching every project, big or small as an opportunity to create something memorable.
