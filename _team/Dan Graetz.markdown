Dan is a self-taught filmmaker with endless curiosity and a love of storytelling.  Since starting as an editor and animator, he’s been on the frontlines of the digital filmmaking revolution in Australia, bringing one of the first RED Digital Cinema Cameras into the country back in 2008.  From there he’s progressed as a cinematographer and director, with a style that blends technical firsts with cinematic sensibilities. 

He’s been fortunate enough to receive numerous awards for his work including a Gold Tripod at the Australian Cinematography Awards for a pioneering motion-control technique, two ARIA Award nominations for Best Music Video, and a Gold at the Branded Entertainment Awards for his viral micro-doc, The Truth About Money In Music.

Dan is passionate about working in unchartered creative and visual territory, and finding ways to tell stories efficiently and meaningfully.
