                <h2>Jono Shaw</h2>
                <h3>director & vfx artist</h3>
                <p><p>Jono graduated from film school over 9 years ago, and since then has been so busy he’s barely slept since. He was one of the lucky few who stepped right into a fulltime career and has worked on everything from directing large live multi-camera productions, shooting and editing documentaries and promos,to creating motion graphics and VFX for a wide range of content for TV and online.</p>

<p>Before joining the team at Light + Shade he successfully ran his own production company for 4 years, and in that time developed a reputation amongst his clients as being one of the hardest working people around, who truly loves what he does.</p>

<p>His breadth of experience means whether he’s creating motion graphics or VFX, he’s passionate about and understands the role they play in telling a larger story that connects with and moves an audience.</p>
