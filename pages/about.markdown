We bend our minds to create an idea that bends your mind, then back that up with the skills and experience to bring that concept to life. Light + Shade is a forward thinking Production Company relentlessly pushing the boundaries in every thing we do.

Once you step through our doors, near enough isn’t good enough. We make it our professional purpose to be proud of every piece of work we make, no matter what size screen it plays on or the budget we have to play with. It’s this creative ambition that keeps us on our toes, that makes us hungry for more and allows us to realize the impossible.

At the heart of our team, is a yearning to collaborate and a deep love for what we do, and to be honest, we wouldn’t have it any other way. We are a hard working team of creative professionals committed to telling unique and powerful stories, films that draw audiences in and push them to think outside the square.

Content and television are our specialties, our aim: to help nurture a story into a powerful and effective narrative, designed to connect viewers with the feeling and emotion of an experience.

At Light + Shade we are proud of our team. Through all our work we make it our purpose to acquire the most cinematic images, seek the most compelling narratives and create unique films that keep eyes on screen and get people talking.
