###Video Production

At the heart of our video production company is an intent to be different. We strive to create work that means something and has an impact on not just our clients bottom line, but the lives of the people watching. It’s this clear purpose that makes the Light + Shade team proud, that stands us out from the crowd and gives us the motivation to keep pushing the boundaries of storytelling. Our model is purposefully different, streamlining the production pipeline, keeping every aspect of the process in house, allowing Light + Shade to deliver high end cinematic standard work for great value across all mediums. Read on for a more detailed description of our different video production services.

###Content Production

With a plethora of content being produced across the globe, Light + Shade approaches our content with a clear goal in mind, to stand out from the crowd. It’s essential that content is original, with thought-provoking narratives that make audiences walk away with a feeling and a connection to something new. Our content directors come from a mixed background of Advertising and Documentary; a blend of skillsets that enable them to see a story that connects while keeping messages on brand, together delivering high-end and high impact results.

Light + Shade’s long and short form programming has been broadcasted to audiences right across the world, both through TV and online platforms. With a professional purpose to produce programs that have heart and jeopardy, the team continues to develop in-house, as well as collaborate with producers of all shapes and sizes, to seek the most interesting and diverse stories from across Australia and the World. 

###TV Commercial Video Production

Light + Shade’s Television Commercial Production spans many different genres, from dramatic through to tech based, human narrative and comedy. Our production pipeline is optimised for large resolution up to 8K and can deliver to any format required on any medium. From Pre-Production through to Post Production, every aspect is carried out under the one roof through well developed and maintained processes. 

###Corporate Video Production

Corporate Video Production has become a great communication tool for companies wishing to reach their customers or staff just about anywhere. Light + Shade’s focus is to guide companies through the production process, being upfront and open with communication to ensure all stakeholders are fully informed along the creative journey. With an aim to produce original, thought provoking pieces for clients, we handle every aspect of the production. This enables us to deliver corporate video production to our clients that is not just a piece of media, but one that reaches and engages with their audience, delivering strong outcomes.

###Our Journey in Video Production: From Brisbane to Melbourne and Sydney

Light + Shade started from Humble beginnings in Brisbane. Founders and Directors Josh Zaini and Matt Bamkin came from a Television Background and started a company that took their storytelling experience and applied it to narrative-based advertising. From there the company grew and moved into more traditional TVC production, and shortly after into long form TV. With a strong development and creative focus, the pair pushed the business to ensure that everything that Light + Shade produced reached its maximum potential. Light + Shade has now been running for over five years and has been based in its new headquarters in Bowen Hills for two. All under the one roof, Light + Shade operates its full in-house Production work flow, built by some of the best creative, production and tech staff to offer clients a one stop shop for all their Video Production needs.

With success in Brisbane, Light + Shade spread its wings to Melbourne and Sydney. This move was not driven by any mission to become a big business, but rather to seek the highest possible standards of work and collaborators in Australia. Now with offices and production facilities in all the capital cities down Australia’s east coast, Light + Shade is able to offer agencies, networks and direct clients with local, personalised service and production, along with access to a huge array of directors. With the pursuit of producing great original work in mind, we are on a nationwide search for the best people to collaborate with, and to produce well-executed and talked about communications that all stakeholders can be proud of.

###Our use of technologies and complementary offerings

Technology never stops, and Light + Shade prides itself on being there on the frontiers of technological advancement. In all the work we produce, new technologies are learned and incorporated to suit each project, from the initial creative to the camera department and into post, we never stop pushing, keeping our clients on the cutting edge. With this push, Light + Shade are now proud to offer Virtual and Augmented reality in house. 

Aerial filming has recently been changed forever by the introduction of Drones. Light + Shade has full CASA accredited pilots capable of flying drones of any size with payloads of up to 20 kilograms. To complement this, the traditional use of helicopters is also available through Light + Shade, from simple out-of-the-door shots to using the Cineflex gimbal system for high-end film production.

With the addition of new collaborators, we now offer stills photography through the addition of several Directors and Cinematographers that began their careers and specialise in stills. Produced by our in-house producers and available alongside our film production pipeline or as a standalone offering, the Stills component complements Light + Shade’s existing business, and positions us as a truly comprehensive media house. Photography offered spans advertising, corporate and magazine with a full suite of re-touching and finishing also available.
