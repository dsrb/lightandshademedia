Light \+ Shade offers a diverse range of services that caters for entire productions or just a tiny part. Video Production services offered include TVC and Content production, through to long and short-form content, as well as Corporate Video Production.

Our model is purposefully different: we stream the production pipeline and keep every aspect of the process in house, which allows Light \+ Shade to deliver high end cinematic standard work for great value across all mediums. Light \+ Shade offers a diverse range of directors right across Australia which allows us to fit the right director to the right production, ensuring that the creative suits the audience, maximising results.

Light \+ Shade’s pursuit of great work makes us driven to be proud of every single piece of work that goes out our doors and we’ll stop at nothing on this creative pursuit.
