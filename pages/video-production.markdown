Light \+ Shade offers a diverse range of services that caters for entire productions or just a tiny part. Video Production services offered include TVC and Content production, through to long and short-form content, as well as Corporate Video Production.

Our model is purposefully different: we stream the production pipeline and keep every aspect of the process in house, which allows Light \+ Shade to deliver high end cinematic standard work for great value across all mediums. Light \+ Shade offers a diverse range of directors right across Australia which allows us to fit the right director to the right production, ensuring that the creative suits the audience, maximising results.

Light \+ Shade’s pursuit of great work makes us driven to be proud of every single piece of work that goes out our doors and we’ll stop at nothing on this creative pursuit. Our intent to be different, to stand out from the crowd, and to go above and beyond to make a positive difference in the lives of others, are what gives us the motivation to keep pushing the boundaries of storytelling.
